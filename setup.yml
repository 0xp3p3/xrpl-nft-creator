      title: "Big Buck Bunny"
      description: >-
        When Big Bucks day gets turned upside down by the loss of his favorite butterflies via some rotten rodents, he takes to the offensive to avenge his friends.
        This is a short animated, comedic, and light-hearted movie that has stood the test of time.

        Code-named "Project Peach" by the Blender Institute, the film was made using a free and open-source software application called Blender.
        

        This short film was released in 2008 under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.


        This NFT is a distribution of that original work.  By releasing this work as an NFT, It's my hope to accomplish the following:

        1) Preserve the work of this media on a decentralized platform

        2) Bring awareness to XRPs ability to create NFTs on the ledger easily and efficiently

        3) Show the benefits of having an XRP wallet as the NFT vs a "token"

        4) Raise money for some great open source projects/foundations
